These tools enable Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management partners and independent software vendors (ISVs) to create and manage one-box development instances of Supply Chain Management that use cloud or edge scale units.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/SCMScaleUnitDevTools/wiki) provides documentation for how to use the tools.
