# How to contribute

We use the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow for contributions.
Please read- and understand the flow before contributing.

## Prerequisites

You will need [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.1 or higher to compile the code in this project.

It can be installed with Visual Studio 2019, as well.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), where a major version increment means that the release contains a breaking change (incompatible with older versions of application or platform).

The minor version is incremented automatically for PR that gets merged into the `main` branch.

To increment the major version for a release from a PR, make sure that you have any commit in the brach with `#major` in the commit message.
